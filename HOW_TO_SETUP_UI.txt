Here's a step-by-step guide to creating the UI for the knowledge check system in the Unity Editor:

**1. Create the Knowledge Check Panel:**

*   In the Hierarchy window, right-click and go to `UI -> Panel`. This will create a new Panel object, which will serve as the background for your knowledge check UI.
*   Rename the Panel to `KnowledgeCheckPanel`.
*   With the `KnowledgeCheckPanel` selected, go to the Inspector window and make sure the `Rect Transform` is set to stretch to the full screen. You can do this by clicking the anchor preset box and selecting the bottom-right stretch option while holding `Alt` and `Shift`.
*   You can customize the color and transparency of the panel by adjusting the `Color` property of the `Image` component on the `KnowledgeCheckPanel`.

**2. Add the Text:**

*   Right-click on the `KnowledgeCheckPanel` in the Hierarchy and go to `UI -> Text - TextMeshPro`. This will create a new Text object as a child of the panel.
*   Rename the Text object to `QuestionText`.
*   Select the `QuestionText` object and in the Inspector, change the `Text` property to something like: "Your knowledge has been tested. Choose your reward wisely."
*   You can adjust the font, font size, color, and alignment of the text to your liking.

**3. Create the Buttons:**

*   Right-click on the `KnowledgeCheckPanel` in the Hierarchy and go to `UI -> Button - TextMeshPro`. This will create a new Button object.
*   Rename the Button object to `IntelligenceButton`.
*   Select the `IntelligenceButton` and in the Inspector, find the `Text (TMP)` child object and change its `Text` property to "Intelligence".
*   Duplicate the `IntelligenceButton` twice to create two more buttons.
*   Rename the duplicates to `StrengthButton` and `AgilityButton`.
*   Change the text of the `StrengthButton` to "Strength" and the `AgilityButton` to "Agility".
*   Arrange the three buttons on the `KnowledgeCheckPanel` as you see fit. You can use the `Rect Transform` properties to position them.

**4. Hook up the UI to the Scripts:**

*   Create a new empty GameObject in your scene and name it `UIManager`.
*   Add the `UIManager.cs` script to this GameObject.
*   Create another empty GameObject and name it `KnowledgeManager`.
*   Add the `KnowledgeManager.cs` script to this GameObject.
*   Create a `GameManager` object if you haven't already and attach the `GameManager.cs` script.

**5. Connect the UI Elements:**

*   Select the `KnowledgeManager` GameObject in the Hierarchy.
*   In the Inspector, you will see a `Knowledge Panel` field. Drag the `KnowledgeCheckPanel` from the Hierarchy into this field.
*   Select the `UIManager` GameObject.
*   In the Inspector, you will see a `Player Controller` field. Drag your `Player` object (the one with the `PlayerController.cs` script) into this field.
*   By default, the `KnowledgeCheckPanel` should be disabled. You can do this by unchecking the box next to its name in the Inspector. The `KnowledgeManager` will enable it when needed.

**6. Connect the Button Clicks:**

*   Select the `IntelligenceButton` in the Hierarchy.
*   In the Inspector, scroll down to the `Button` component and find the `On Click ()` section.
*   Click the `+` icon to add a new event.
*   Drag the `UIManager` GameObject from the Hierarchy into the `None (Object)` field.
*   Click on the `No Function` dropdown and select `UIManager -> OnIntelligenceButtonClicked()`.
*   Repeat this process for the `StrengthButton` and `AgilityButton`, selecting the `OnStrengthButtonClicked()` and `OnAgilityButtonClicked()` methods respectively.

**7. Testing:**

*   Play your game and defeat an enemy that drops a mask piece.
*   The `KnowledgeCheckPanel` should appear, and the game should pause.
*   Click on one of the buttons. The panel should disappear, the game should resume, and the corresponding damage bonus should be applied if you are holding the correct weapon.
*   Defeat another enemy. The panel should not appear again.

That's it! You have now successfully created and integrated the knowledge check UI into your game.
